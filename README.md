# Module_1_Challenge

## Description

When creating this project, I set out to provide the marketing agency, 'Horiseon', with a website that meets accessibility standards, as well as having semantic and logical code. By completing this assignment, I learned how the naming of elements can greatly influence one's understanding of a webpage.
